%% PLANETOOLS 2022 VS PLANETOOLS
% Simplified new dynamic thrust model
% ODE solvers rather than for loops for flight condition convergence
% Battery decay model
% Motor thermal model
% Fuselage/wing propwash drag model
% Full course simulation
% Much simpler code
% About 100x as fast (1 sec vs 60 seconds), further sped up by
% parallelization in for loops for trade studies
% Simplified with MATLAB struct objects rather than custom objects
% No units - all SI base units
% No in-process unit conversions
% Greatly simplified code base (~600 lines vs. ~50,000-100,000 lines)
% Soon: thorough project documentation + potential integration with CAD/CFD
