Code:
Me:
Wire resistance
Heat effects on motor resistance (ThrustModel)
Propwash drag on fuselage and wings (FlightModel)
Drag & weight breakdown (PlaneTools)

Aaron:
Scoring
Trade studies
Refine weight and drag buildup
Import airfoils, motors, batteries

Rubber FlightModel (computationally light, rubber components, large tradestudies):
1 takeoff, 1 cruise, 1 turn for each of the two missions with rubber Kv, resistance function of Kv, and prop
Use fastest MATLAB ode solver
Generalize to score missions
Parallelize and run vast trade studies

Research/model for Plastic:
hA measurement for motor, then add heat effects (ThrustModel)
ESC and battery resistance measurement (planefiles / battery objects)

Verification of CD0 methods:
StarSCream buildup w/o propwash - CFD, car drag testing on Expo
Summer plane buildup PT w/ propwash - CFD w/ propwash, net thrust w/propwash, and performance data, 
Same w/ ExSCalibur/SCkyfall

READ 2020 Report
Read Lublijana report and make notes of procedural/design improvements that can be made

- Rubber very large trade studies (gets rough geom, payloads & propulsion) >
- Plastic with fixed propulsion components (fixed propulsion, gets better geom, payloads & propulsion) >
- Steel with flexible CD0 and aircraft m (tells us relative benefits of reducing weight and drag)
- CFD CD0 & CAD aircraft m (tells us where/how drag & mass can be reduced)

LOOP:
- Build, test fly and compare to Steel w/ final mass (assuming prop. model is accurate, tells us real CD0 & therefore scale factor w/ CFD)
- Make design changes in CAD and evaluate results in Steel w/ scaled CFD-based CD0 (tells us where/how drag & mass can be reduced)
- Rerun Plastic adjusting only payloads and propulsion to refine
